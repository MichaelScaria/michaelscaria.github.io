**What did you do this past week?**

I worked on understanding the math of allocator problem on hacker rank. Initially I didn't understand how the sentinels were supposed to be set up, but after the examples on problem were posted it made more sense to me. Along with that, I've been working on setting up a cron job for a project I'm working on to create medication reminders on an app called Docket that I'm the lead iOS engineer for. 

**What's in your way?**

Nothing is in my way right now other than the cruise.

**What will you do next week?**

I'm on a cruise for spring break but I won't have access to internet. I am getting flown out for Docket this weekend to New York, where I'll get to meet the founders and talk about the future of Docket. I think it has a lot of potential to help patients communciate with their doctors. Also we are thinking about making all of the data FHIR compliant so that anybody can look up our specfication and understand our data if we give them access.


**What's my experience of the class?**

The class is going well. I think that learning about how the heap works without getting into the nitty gritty details like we did in Operating Systems is nice becuase it reminds me a lot of stuff I learned about and helps me brush up on it.

**What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

My tip of the week is to remember to push your commits before you go on a cruise. I think this applies to a lot of events in life, if you don't push your commits, you can hinder the progress of those you work with.
